"""The stove's weekly heating schedule: 7 days, two time slots per day.

The bridge gives each slot as one integer, HHMMHHMM (start then end, leading zero dropped: 7001230 is 07:00 to
12:30), and 0 for a slot that is off. They are records 7 to 20 of `controls_pos` in /api/state, and are commanded
under the names below on /api/controls.

The main way to set it is a Home Assistant schedule (the "Schedule" helper, edited as a weekly grid): the button
"copy" sends its plan to the stove, see slots_from_ha_schedule(). The stove takes two slots per day.

A slot can also be edited as two times (entities disabled by default). A change is kept here, pending, and nothing is sent to the stove
until the "send" button is pressed: the whole schedule then goes in one command, so the stove never sees a slot
whose start was changed and whose end was not yet.
